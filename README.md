# CodeAlpha-Data-Science-Titanic-Project

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to explore the factors that contributed to passenger survival. By applying data visualization techniques, this project aims to uncover trends and insights that could explain the variations in survival rates among different passenger groups.

Project Overview
The analysis covers several aspects of the Titanic dataset, including:

Age Distribution: Observing age distribution among passengers and its correlation with survival.
Fare Distribution: Analyzing fare ranges and their association with survival outcomes.
Survival by Age and Gender: Exploring survival rates across age groups and genders.
Class and Gender Influence on Survival: Examining how passenger class and gender impacted survival likelihood.
Project Structure
Data Loading: The dataset is loaded and inspected for structure and data types.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations are created to highlight patterns and key features in the dataset:
Age Distribution Histogram - Shows passenger age distribution.
Fare Distribution KDE Plot - Compares fare distributions between those who survived and those who did not.
Age vs. Survival KDE Plot - Examines survival rates by age group.
Gender and Class Survival Rates - Shows survival rates by gender and passenger class.

Libraries Used
Pandas for data manipulation
Matplotlib for data visualization
Seaborn for enhanced plotting
Dataset
The project uses a Titanic dataset file (titanic_comp.csv). Please ensure this file is present in the same directory as the Python script.

Insights
Key insights from this project include:

Age and Survival: Younger passengers, especially children, had a higher survival rate.
Fare and Survival: Higher ticket fares correlated with increased survival chances.
Gender and Class: Women and passengers in higher classes had better survival rates.
